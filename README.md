## Pizza Hut Sales Data Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data to acquire insight into customer preferences, revenue generation, and ordering trends. The dataset utilized in this analysis comprises information about pizza sales in 2015. My goal in examining the data is to gain significant insights that will help drive business decisions and optimize the pizza shop's operations.

##Introduction
Understanding client inclinations and advertise patterns is vital for businesses to flourish in a competitive environment. The pizza industry is no special case, with clients having a wide extend of choices and inclinations when it comes to pizza flavours, sizes, and categories. Analyzing deals information permits us to pick up a more profound understanding of client behaviour, distinguish well known pizza choices, and recognize designs in client orders. 

The main objectives of this analysis are as follows:
•	Examine customer preferences in terms of pizza size, category, and ingredients.
•	Analyze revenue generation and identify the highest revenue-generating categories and pizzas.
•	Investigate order patterns, such as peak order times, popular days, and average order quantities.
•	Uncover any notable trends or patterns in customer behaviour and preferences.

# Data Analysis Process
In this project, I have followed a systematic approach to analyze the pizza sales data and derive meaningful insights. The analysis process involved the following steps:
1. Data Collection: The link to the dataset is given below: https://github.com/Ayushi0214/pizza-s... 
2. Dataset Description: This pizza sales dataset make up 12 relevant features.
•	pizza_type_id: The unique identifier for each pizza type in the dataset.
•	pizza_id: The unique identifier for each pizza in the dataset.
•	order_id: The unique identifier for each pizza order.
•	quantity: The number of pizzas ordered in each transaction.
•	order_date: The date when the pizza order was placed.
•	order_time: The time at which the pizza order was placed.
•	Pizza_price: The price of a single unit of pizza.
•	total_price: The total price of the pizza order, calculated as the unit price multiplied by the quantity.

•	pizza_ingredients: The list of ingredients used in the pizza preparation.
•	pizza_name: The name or label assigned to each specific pizza

4. Data Preprocessing: I performed data cleaning and transformation to ensure the dataset's quality and suitability for analysis. This included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting data types.
5. Normalization: The normalization process aims to organize the dataset into multiple tables, minimize redundancy, and establish relationships between entities. Dataset is divided into four tables. pizzas table, orders table, Order details table, Pizza types table.
6. SQL Queries: I have utilized SQL queries to extract relevant information from the dataset. This involved querying the database to obtain insights into customer preferences, revenue generation, and order patterns.
